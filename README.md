# Sonnet-App
## Synopsis

The Sonnet App was created with one goal in mind: to allow the average poetry lover to create their own version of Raymond Queneau's "Cent mille milliards de po√®mes" (A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems).
By dragging and swiping, the user is able to replace or re-order the existing sonnet, thereby creating an entirely new work.
